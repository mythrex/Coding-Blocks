    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an Engineering student pursuing to become a top-notch
      web developer. Sitting in classes bores me so I lock my self
       in my room and try to do something productive. Within 1 year
        of my college I have learned to program neat and classy. The
         excitement of learning new is the only thing that is keeping
          me happy and alive. I have learned C programming from an awesome
           book -"Let us C -by Yashwant Kanetkar". Codecdemy.com helped me
            to learn HTML and CSS. From online resources I have learned a
             front-end framework "Bootstrap". </p>

    <h2>My skills</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>HTML:</dt>
      <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
         the Web. It is most basic language to learn to create a website. There
          is no other alternative for that. I have used wix and wordpress, but
          that excitement to make a webpage is felt only when I learned HTML. </dd>
      <dt>Javascript</dt>
      <dd>Javascript is fun to learn and write. All I can say about it that I am
        still learning it and I am sure I will not stop any time in near future. </dd>
        <dt>Bootstrap</dt>
        <dd>I Bootstrap. I have made 4-5 projects on bootstrap and all
          I can say is I love the framework. I have now firm grip on Bootstrap v3. </dd>
